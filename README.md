# LAMP-project

This LAMP project was for my Database Design and Implementation class. We started by first individually designing applications we wanted to create. 

For my LAMP project, I wanted to create an application for food/restaurant search. We started with the back end. After creating a mock-up database with multiple tables for the application, I wrote MySQL queries to pull the data for different types of commands that would be available on my application. 

Next, we created the front end through HTML, CSS, and PHP. The PHP pulled the correct data according to the userâ€™s specifications. In addition, there was a data entry portion where new items and restaurants could be added to the database. This portion was protected by .htaccess for security purposes.
